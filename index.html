    <h1><em>Natural greenspace (or lack thereof) in Red Hook</em></h1>

    <h2>The small, vibrant community living within shouting distance of Governors Island and the Statue of Liberty is in the midst of seismic change.</h2>


    <h3>December 9, 2021</h3>

    <h4>By: Kellen Bulger</h4>

    <p>It was announced in 2017 that Red Hook Recreation Area would undergo a multi-year project to remove historical lead contamination. This reconstruction would also remove all grass fields in exchange for artificial ones.</p>

    <p>“They’re going to turn it all into turf. I think this is a really, really big loss,” Red Hook resident, and South Brooklyn Running Club Captain Illya Tarasenko said.
    </p>
        
    <p>In the southwest area of Brooklyn encompassing Red Hook, <a href="https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/map/1377/walking-distance-to-a-park#1377/a/4/1623/25/a/a">94 percent</a> of the residents live more than a quarter mile away from a recreational park.</p>

    <section class="graph">
        <div>
            <iframe title="Percentage of NYC Residents 1/4 Mile from a Park " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-w64cZ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/w64cZ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="774"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
            </script>
    </div>
    </section>
    <h5>The graph above compares and contrasts which NYC neighborhoods have the highest tnumber of residents at a distance from a recreational park.</h5>

    <p>Tarasenko said the lead cleanup is a positive, but there are other factors at play.

        <h5>Protective fencing wraps not only around the perimeter of the park at the Red Hook Recreation area, but similarly along the trees near the street in order to protect them from construction activities.</h5>

    <p> “It’s gonna look cool, it’s gonna be awesome, it’s gonna get used. There’s a loss there,” Tarasenko said.
